******
v0.7.0
******

The following sections have the details on the release. This release has been
verified with `TF-A v2.13`_ release.

============================
New features in this release
============================

- Deprivileging RMM code via EL0 App support

  *  Introduced a framework for building, packaging, and executing EL0 apps.
  *  Restructured the RMM code base to build certain components as separate
     EL0 applications.
  *  Moved the Attestation and pseudo-random number generator functionality
     to EL0 Apps.
  *  Added `fake-host` support to run EL0 applications.
  *  Added a supporting design document.

- Added some RMMv1.1 APIs

  *  Implemented ``RMI_DEV_MEM_(UN)MAP`` commands.
  *  Added support for device granules in ``RMI_GRANULE_DELEGATE`` and
     ``RMI_GRANULE_UNDELEGATE`` commands.

======================================
Bug fixes/improvements in this release
======================================

- EL0 App framework fixes and improvements

  *  Collected app artifacts in a single location.
  *  Fixed the path to the EL0 apps linker script.
  *  Refactored the host-common layer to separate El2-EL0 shared and
     EL2-specific code.
  *  Enforced 64KB alignment for the RMM Core to meet ELF loader requirements.
  *  Forced lld to apply link time reloc values - this is to resolve issue
     with App execution when linked using LLD.

- Enable Generic PL011 UART config - This reduces the PL011 driver
  to operate on the SBSA Generic UART register subset.

- Enabled ``-fstack-protector-strong`` compiler flag for stack protection.

- Added support to read device memory info from the Boot manifest at EL3 and
  handle DEV granules in RMM.

- Fixed various ``clang-tidy-18`` errors.

- Hid MPAM from Realms and trap access to MPAM registers from Realm. Since RMM
  does not support configuring MPAM for Realms, disabled FEAT_MPAM for Realms.

- Disabled BRBE at R-EL2 and R-EL1.

- Modified ``handle_sysreg_access_trap`` to skip advancing PC to allow injecting
  UNDEF abort back into Realms.

- Added -Wstrict-aliasing compiler flag.

- Fixed PMU save/restore register sequence in RMM.

  * RMM now saves/restores all NS event counters, even if realm is not
    using all counters.
  * Removed pmxevcntr_el0 and pmxevtyper_el0 registers from
    saving/restoring as they are aliases for pmevcntrN_el0 and pmevtyperN_el0,
    selected by pmselr_el0.sel.
  * Removed saving pmcntenclr_el0, pmintenclr_el1 and pmovsclr_el0. These
    registers are restored with inverted values of pmcntenset_el0,
    pmintenset_el1 and pmovsset_el0.

- Improved performance by clearing granule memory after MMU is enabled.

- Updated default cases for handling SEAs and SEIs so that they call
  system_abort() instead of asserting.

- Corrected the DFSC macro value for asynchronous SError exceptions
  from ``0x1`` to ``0x11``.

- Fixed missing ``break`` in ``fake_host`` when processing monitor call ID.

- Added ``-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks`` to disable optimization that can
  remove such checks.

- Added -Wextra compile flag for more warnings.

- Introduced additional compiler options: `-Wstrict-overflow` and
  ``-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2``. Note: `FORTIFY_SOURCE` is added for
  future-proofing; RMM does not currently link against ``glibc``.

- Added the `-Wnull-dereference` compile option to Debug build of RMM.
  It is added only to Debug build as it shows false positives for Release
  build.

- Removed the redundant granule_unlock() in smc_rec_create error path
  when Aux granule is not found.

- Fixed Coverity MISRA compliance issues.

- Correctly configured PSTATE flags (``TCO``, ``DIT``, ``UAO``, ``PAN``,
  ``SSBS``, ``BTYPE``) during abort injection to R-EL1.

- Added missing `top_gran_align` check to `RMI_RTT_SET_RIPAS` ABI.

- Added support in RMI_VERSION and RSI_VERSION commands to report lower and
  higher supported interface revisions.

- Fixed a missing call to release the shared buffer between EL3 and RMM in
  one of the error code paths of the EL3_TOKEN_SIGN attestation flow.

==================================
Build/Testing/Tooling improvements
==================================

- Updated minimum CMake version requirement to 3.20. This is needed
  to support the build for EL0 app framework.

- Upgraded jinja2 from 3.1.5 to 3.1.6 for document generation

- Explicitly set C++ standard for Unit tests (which are written in C++).

- Removed variable size arrays in some unittests.

- Added support for updating git submodules during configuration of RMM.
  This ensures updated dependencies are automatically integrated during
  builds, particularly after project rebases. This also ties in with the
  patching mechanism in RMM wherein a particular SHA is assumed for the
  submodules.

- Updated Shrinkwrap overlay to add PCIE DOE and IDE parameters for
  the FVP to facilitate CCA DA development.

- Switched to importing `libspdm` via git submodules instead of a custom
  CMake mechanism.

- Moved git utils cmake helpers to ``cmake/`` folder.

=========
Platforms
=========

- Added initial platform support for RD-V3-R1. RD-V3-R1 and
  RD-V3-R1-Cfg1 Fixed Virtual Platforms are Arm Neoverse Reference Design
  platforms with ARMv9 RME enabled CPUs.

============================
Known issues and limitations
============================

- Some capabilities mentioned in `RMM v1.0 REL0 specification`_ are
  restricted or absent in TF-RMM as listed below:

  * The support for Self-hosted debug in Realms is not implemented (`issue#23`_).

=================
Upcoming features
=================

- Prototype new features as described in `RMM v1.1 Alpha 13 specification`_.

  *  Realm Device Assignment - A feature which allows devices to be assigned to Realms,
     attested and granted permission to access Realm owned memory.
  *  Planes - A feature which allows a Realm to be divided into multiple
     mutually isolated execution environments, called Planes.
  *  Support FEAT_MEC in the Realm world.

- Continue to enhance CBMC analysis to support more RMI commands.

- Fuzz testing for RMM utilizing the `fake_host` architecture.

- Implement support for Self-hosted debug in Realms.

- Support Live Firmware Activation of RMM.

- Add isb() after writes to `cptr_el2` system register.

- Fix the granule alignment check on granule_addr.

- Fix some cppcheck warnings.

- Properly handle errors for granule (un)delegate calls.

- Fix the incorrect bit map manipulation for tracking VMID for realms.

- Fix some incorrect Block mapping cases in Stage 2 translation.

=================
Upcoming features
=================

- RMM EAC Specification alignment.

- Support Self-Hosted Debug Realms.

- Support FEAT_PAuth for Realms and utilize the same for RMM.

- Support LPA2 for Stage 2 Realm translation tables.

- Threat model covering RMM data flows.

- Enable Bounded Model Checker (CBMC) for source analysis.

- Save and restore SME/SME2 context belonging to NS Host. This allows NS Host
  to make use of SME/SME2 when Realms are scheduled.

============================
Known issues and limitations
============================

- The size of ``RsiHostCall`` structure is 256 bytes in the implementation
  and aligns to `RMM Beta1 specification`_ rather than the 4 KB size
  specified in `RMM Beta0 specification`_.

- The `RMM Beta0 specification`_ does not require to have a CBOR bytestream
  wrapper around the cca-platform-token and cca-realm-delegated-token, but
  the RMM implementation does so and this is aligned with later versions
  of the RMM specification (Beta2 onwards).

- The RMM config ``RMM_FPU_USE_AT_REL2`` does not work as intended and
  this config is disabled by default. This will be fixed in a future release.

- When the ``RSI_ATTEST_TOKEN_CONTINUE`` call is interrupted and then resumed
  later by Host via ``RMI_REC_ENTER``, the original SMC is replayed again
  with the original arguments rather than returning ``RSI_INCOMPLETE`` error
  code to Realm. The result is that the interrupted RSI call is continued
  again till completion and then returns back to Realm with the appropriate
  error code.

.. _TF-A v2.9: https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tag/?h=v2.9.0


******
v0.2.0
******

- This release has been verified with `TF-A v2.8`_ release.

- The release has the following fixes and enhancements:

   * Add support to render documentation on read-the-docs.
   * Fix the known issue with RSI_IPA_STATE_GET returning
     ``RSI_ERROR_INPUT`` for a `destroyed` IPA instead of
     emulating data abort to NS Host.
   * Fix an issue with RSI_HOST_CALL not returning back to Host
     to emulate a stage2 data abort.
   * Harden an assertion check for ``do_host_call()``.

- The other known issues and limitations remain the same as
  listed for v0.1.0_.

.. _TF-A v2.8: https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tag/?h=v2.8.0

******
v0.1.0
******

-  First TF-RMM source release aligned to `RMM Beta0 specification`_.
   The specified interfaces : Realm Management Interface (RMI) and
   Realm Service Interface (RSI) are implemented which can attest
   and run Realm VMs as described by the `Arm CCA`_ Architecture.

=================
Upcoming features
=================

-  Support SVE, Self-Hosted Debug and PMU in Realms
-  Support LPA2 for Stage 2 Realm translation tables.
-  Threat model covering RMM data flows.
-  Enable Bounded Model Checker (CBMC) for source analysis.
-  Unit test framework based on :ref:`RMM Fake host architecture`.

============================
Known issues and limitations
============================

The following is a list of issues which are expected to be fixed in the future
releases of TF-RMM :

-  The size of ``RsiHostCall`` structure is 256 bytes in the implementation
   and aligns to `RMM Beta1 specification`_ rather than the 4 KB size
   specified in `RMM Beta0 specification`_.

-  The RSI_IPA_STATE_GET command returns error ``RSI_ERROR_INPUT`` for a
   `destroyed` IPA instead of emulating data abort to Host.

-  The `RMM Beta0 specification`_ does not require to have a CBOR bytestream
   wrapper around the cca-platform-token and cca-realm-delegated-token, but
   the RMM implementation does so.
