  Overlay to build TF-RMM with standard build settings.
  In order to use this overlay, the RMM_SRC btvar must be defined containing
  the absolute path for the local TF-RMM repository.

  The overlay allows to overwrite the default log level for TF-RMM, by
  using ``RMM_LOG_LEVEL`` btvar as well as to define the SHA/Branch of TF-A
  to be used for the particular instance of RMM to build through the
  ``TFA_REVISION`` btvar. It also allows to define the host platform through
  the ``RMM_CONFIG`` btvar.

  btvars:
    # Determines where the TF-RMM source root directory is

      value: null

    # Determines the RMM Log level
    RMM_LOG_LEVEL:
      type: string
      value: '40'

    # Determines the RMM Configuration (a.k.a. platform) to build
    RMM_CONFIG:
      type: string
      value: 'fvp_defcfg'

    # Determines the branch or SHA to pull for TF-A which is suitable
    # for the current RMM
    TFA_REVISION:
      type: string
      value: master
