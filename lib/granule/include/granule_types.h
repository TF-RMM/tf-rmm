/*
 * Locking Order
 * -------------
 * Granules must be locked in a specific order to prevent deadlocks.
 *
 * We define two classes of granule states: `external` and `internal`.
 *
 * A granule state belongs to the `external` class iff _any_ parameter to _any_
 * RMI command is an address of a granule which is expected to be in that state
 * i.e the lock is only acquired if the granule state of the address in RMI
 * command matches to that of the expected state.
 *
 * The following granule states are `external`:
 *
 * - GRANULE_STATE_NS
 * - GRANULE_STATE_DELEGATED
 * - GRANULE_STATE_RD
 * - GRANULE_STATE_REC
 * - GRANULE_STATE_PDEV
 * - GRANULE_STATE_VDEV
 * - DEV_GRANULE_STATE_NS
 * - DEV_GRANULE_STATE_DELEGATED
 *
 * Otherwise a granule state is considered `internal`.
 *
 * The following granule states are `internal`:
 *
 * - GRANULE_STATE_RTT
 * - GRANULE_STATE_DATA
 * - GRANULE_STATE_REC_AUX
 * - GRANULE_STATE_PDEV_AUX
 * - GRANULE_STATE_VDEV_AUX
 * - DEV_GRANULE_STATE_MAPPED
 *
 * The following locking rules must be followed in all cases:
 *
 * 1. Granules expected to be in an `external` state must be locked before
 *    locking any granules in an `internal` state.
 *
 * 2. Granules expected to be in an `external` state must be locked in order
 *    of their physical address, starting with the lowest address.
 *
 * 3. Once a granule expected to be in an `external` state has been locked, its
 *    state must be checked against the expected state. If these do not match,
 *    the granule must be unlocked and no further granules may be locked.
 *
 * 4. Granules in an `internal` state must be locked in order of state:
 *    1. `RTT`
 *    2. `DATA`
 *    3. `DEV_MAPPED`
 *    4. `REC_AUX`
 *    5. `PDEV_AUX`
 *
 * 5. Granules in the same `internal` state must be locked in the order defined
 *    below for that specific state.
 *
 * A granule's state can be changed iff the granule is locked.
 *
 * Invariants
 * ----------
 * GRANULE_STATE_DELEGATED is special, in that it is the gateway between the
 * non-secure and realm world.  We maintain the property that any unlocked
 * granule with state == GRANULE_STATE_DELEGATED contains only zeroes; while
 * locked these may contain non-zero values.

 * The RD may only be destroyed when the following objects
 * have a reference count of zero:
 * - The root-level RTT
 */
#define GRANULE_STATE_RD		2U

/*
 * Realm Execution Context Granule (external)
 *
 * Granule content (see struct rec) comprises execution
 * context state and cached realm information copied from the RD.
 *
 * Execution context is not protected by granule::lock, because we can't
 * enter a Realm while holding the lock.
 *
 * The following rules with respect to the granule's reference apply:
 * - A reference is held on this granule when a REC is running.
 * - As REC cannot be run on two PEs at the same time, the maximum
 *   value of the reference count is one.
 * - When the REC in entered, the reference count is incremented
 *   (set to 1) atomically while granule::lock is held.
 * - When the REC exits, the reference counter is released (set to 0)
 *   atomically with store-release semantics without granule::lock being
 *   held.
 * - The RMM can access the granule's content on the entry and exit path
 *   from the REC while the reference is held.

/*
 * Realm Execution Context auxiliary granule (internal)
 *
 * Granule auxiliary content is used to store any state that cannot
 * fit in the main REC page. This is typically used for context
 * save/restore of PE features like SVE, SME, etc.
 *
 * Granule content is not protected by granule::lock nor the reference
 * count. The RMM can access the content of the auxiliary granules
 * only while holding a lock or reference to the parent REC granule.
 *
 * The granule::lock is held during a state change to
 * GRANULE_STATE_REC_AUX and from GRANULE_STATE_REC_AUX.
 *
 * The complete internal locking order when changing REC_AUX
 * granule's state is:
 *
 * REC -> REC_AUX[0] -> REC_AUX[1] -> ... -> REC_AUX[n-1]

/*
 * Data Granule (internal)
 *
 * Granule content is not protected by granule::lock, as it is always

 *
 * A granule in this state is always referenced from exactly one entry
 * in an RTT granule which must be locked before locking this granule.
 * Only a single DATA granule can be locked at a time.
 * The complete internal locking order for DATA granules is:
 *
 * RD -> RTT -> RTT -> ... -> DATA
 *
 * No references are held on this granule type.

 *
 * Granule content is protected by granule::lock, but hardware
 * translation table walks may read the RTT at any point in time.
 * TODO: do we wish/need to use hardware access flag management?
 *
 * Multiple granules in this state can only be locked at the same time
 * if they are part of the same tree, and only in topological order
 * from root to leaf. The topological order of concatenated root level
 * RTTs is from lowest address to highest address.
 *
 * The complete internal locking order for RTT granules is:
 *
 * RD -> [RTT] -> ... -> RTT
 *
 * A reference is held on this granule for each entry in the RTT that
 * refers to a granule:
 *   - Table s2tte.
 *   - Assigned_RAM s2tte.
 *   - Assigned_NS s2tte.
 *   - Assigned s2tte.
